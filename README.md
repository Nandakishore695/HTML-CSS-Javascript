**25.What Variable in javascript?**
- Variable is a container for storing data values. It is declared using the var, let, or const keyword. Variables can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, or objects

**26.What is isNaN in JavaScript?**
- isNaN() is a function is used to check whether the given value is an illegal number or not. If it returns true, the value is a Not a number. Else returns false. It value is a number.

**27.What is the difference between slice and splice?**

slice() and splice() methods are used widely for array manipulations. 

**Slice() Method:**
- Slice method is used to create a new array from the original array. It takes two arguments the starting index, indicat where to begin the slice, and the ending index is not included in the slice array.

**Splice() Method:**
- Splice method is used to add or remove items from the original array. It takes n number of arguments the starting index, indicat where the modification should begin, and the number of elements to be removed. Additionally, you can include optional arguments to specify new elements to be add.

**28.What is this keyword in JavaScript?**
- This keyword refers to the current windows object. 

**29.What are some of the built-in methods in JavaScript?**

JavaScript provides a variety of built-in methods are:
| String Methods | Array Methods | Number Methods | Math Methods| Date Methods| Function Methods|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| charAt()  | push() | toFixed() | Math.random() |getDate()|bind()|
| concat()  | pop()   |parseInt()|Math.floor()| getMonth()|apply()|
|toLowerCase()|unshift()| parseFloat()|Math.round()|getFullYear()|call()|
|toUpperCase()|shift()||Math.ceil()|getHours()|

**30.Difference between Client-side JavaScript and Server-side JavaScript?**

**Client-side:**
- Code is executed on the user's web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Primarily responsible for the user interface and user experience
- It handles form validating, animations
- Code is visible and accessible to users
- Use local storage and cookies

**Server-side:**
- Code is executed on the server such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js
- Interacts with databases, it is responsible for processing requests, managing user authentication,
- Code is not visible to users

**31.Difference between map and foreach?**

Both are array methods that are used to iterate the elements of the array.
- map() method will return a new array
- forEach() method will not return anything and returns undefined.

**32.What is loop and how many types of loops What is the difference between for... of and for... in javascript?**

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition true.

**It has 5 types of loops are:**
- for loop
- while loop
- do while loop
- for in loop
- for of loop

**For in loop** is use when you want to go through the properties of an object.
```
var animal = {name: "tiger", leg: 4};
for(let key in animal){
   console.log(key) // Expected output: name, leg
   console.log(key, animal[key]) // Expected output: name tiger, leg 4
}
```
**For of loop** is use when you want to go through each item in a collection.
```
var person = ["Nandakishore", Naveen, Bajrang];
for(let index of person){
   console.log(index) // Expected output: 0, 1, 2
   console.log(index, person[index]) // Expected output: 0 Nandakishore, 1 Naveen, 2 Bajrang
}
```
**33.What is callback hell?**
- Callback hell mean inside a function multiple nested callback

**34.What are Promises?**
- A promise is an object that may produce a single value in the future, either resolved with a value or rejected with a reason (error). Promises are in three states:

**Pending**

**Fulfilled**

**Rejected**
```
var result = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
	var bool = true;
	If(bool){
	   resolve(“it is true”);
	}
	else{ 
	   reject(“it’s false”);
}
)
console.log(result);
result.then(function(value){ console.log(value);})
      .catch(function(value){ console.log(value);})
```
**35.What are the possible ways to create objects?**
- Object is a collection of elements, in the form of properties and methods
  
**i.Object literal syntax:**
```
var object = {
     name: "Sudheer",
     age: 34
};
```
**ii.Using new keyword with object constructor**
```
var object = new Object();
```
**iii..Using new keyword with a constructor function**
```
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

var person1 = new Person("John", 30);
```
**iv.Objec.create() Method**
```
const myPrototype = { x: 10, y: 20 };
const myObject = Object.create(myPrototype); 
```
**v.Classes**

**36.Different between Transpiler and Compiler?**
- A transpiler is a tool that converts source code from one high-level programming language(jsx) to angother high-level programming language(Javaascript)
- A compiler is a tool that converts high-level programming language(java) into a lower-level language(machine code or bytecode)

**37.What is Parameter, Argument and Rest Parameter?**
- A parameter is a variable listed in the function declaration
- An argument is the actual value that is passed into the function when it is invoked
- It is represented by three dots (...) followed by a parameter name. 
```
function add(a, b) {
  // 'a' and 'b' are parameters
  return a + b;
}
let result = add(3, 5); // '3' and '5' are argument

function sum(...numbers) {
  // 'numbers' is a rest parameter
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

let result = sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```
**38.What is template literal in ES6 Version?**
- ES6 introduce later versions of JavaScript, called backticks (``) template literal.
- New way to define strings. Template literals have some advantages over traditional string literals enclosed in single or double quotes.
```
//Traditional way
let name = "John";
let greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
let multiLineString = "name: \n Hello\n name "; //for line breaks:'\n'
let stringWithQuotes = "This is a string with single 'quotes' and double \"quotes\".";


//New way
let name = "John";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
let multiLineString = `Line 1
Line 2
Line 3`;
let stringWithQuotes = `This is a string with single 'quotes' and double "quotes".`;
```
**39.Different between `IF/ELSE` vs `Switch`?**
- Both If-else and Switch both are use excuite the conditional the main difference between is if-else statement is executed based on the multiple condition like using logical operator. On the other and switch statements execute as per the user decision.
  
**40. What is the use of strict mode?**
- Strict mode is a feature that was introduced in ECMAScript 5 to help developers write and maintainable code by catching common mistakes and preventing the certain error
```
<script>
"use strict";
function myFunction(a,a) { //show error duplicate defined a parameter
     add = a + 10; // add is not defined at myFunction
     console.log(add)
}
myFunction(5,5)
<script>
```
**41. What is the difference between `Arrow function` and `Normal function`?**
- Arrow functions do not have their own this context.
- regular functions have their own this context, 

**42. Explain about loops different between?**

**43. What is bug explain?**
- Bugs are completely normal in software development
- Problem in a computer program. Any unexpected or unintended behavior of a computer program is a software bug.
- A real bug that causes an error in Harvard's computer in the 1940s

**44. What are debugging tools?**
- Debugging tools are essential for web developers to identify and fix issues in their code.
- Console, Debugging, Postman, Redux DevTool

**45. What is the difference between if-else and ternary?**

**46. How do we handle errors in javascript?**

**47. What is event bubbling and capturing?**

**48. Why do we use the word “debugger” in JavaScript?**
- The word “debugger” is used in JavaScript to refer to a tool that can step through JavaScript code line by line. This can help debug JavaScript code, which is the process of finding and fixing errors in JavaScript code. 

**49. Type Coercion in javascript?**
- Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another. It takes place when the operands of an expression are of different data types.

**45. What is currying in JavaScript?**

**51.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods?**

**52. What do you mean by BOM?**

**53. What are classes in javascript?**

**54. Explain Async/Await?**

**55. What is the difference between Single-thread and multi-thread?**

**56. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous?**
